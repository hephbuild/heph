# Plugin ABI versioning

The in-process stable-ABI plugin transport (`plugin-stabby`) crosses the cdylib
boundary as native stabby vtables (hot path) + prost bytes (cold path). Host and
plugin are compiled separately and linked at load time. The compatibility gate is
stabby's `get_stabbied`: it verifies the plugin's type report (every type reachable
from `CreateFn`) against the host's at load and **hard-fails on any difference**.
So the frozen stabby surface in `crates/plugin-stabby/src/abi.rs` must not drift —
that is what `ABI_SEMVER` (`crates/plugin-abi/src/lib.rs`) tracks.

`scripts/abi-check.sh` (the `abi` job in `.github/workflows/heph.yml`, run on every
PR) enforces this mechanically: if the frozen surface changes without `ABI_SEMVER`
moving, the check fails.

## The dispatch model — most growth is additive, no bump

The cold surface is a **frozen generic dispatch**, not one vtable slot per RPC. A
method is a `pb::ProviderMethod` / `pb::DriverMethod` id carried over the fixed
`invoke*` slots; payloads are prost bytes. So **adding an RPC does NOT touch the
vtable**:

- New RPC = a new `ProviderMethod`/`DriverMethod` enum value + a new guest `match`
  arm. The type report is unchanged, so an older plugin still loads; it answers an
  unknown id with `Error{Unimplemented}` and the host falls back.
- New cold-path wire field, new `RunInFrame`/`RunOutFrame` oneof variant, new
  `pb::CreateConfig` field — all additive (prost ignores unknowns).

**None of these need an `ABI_SEMVER` bump** and none touch `abi.rs`. This additive
lane is the whole point of the dispatch collapse — grow capability without breaking
old plugins. (Bump the minor only if you want to *signal* the new capability.)

## When `ABI_SEMVER` MUST be bumped (major) — the frozen surface changed

Any change to the native stabby surface in `crates/plugin-stabby/src/abi.rs`, i.e.
anything `get_stabbied` would reject:

- Add, remove, reorder, or re-sign a method on a `#[stabby::stabby]` trait — the
  vtable slots: `StableProvider`, `StableManagedDriver` (the `invoke*` slots),
  `StableExecutor`, `StableItemStream`, `StableRead`, `StableArtifactContent`,
  `StableFunctionRegistry`, `StableMeta`, `StableCancel`, `StableHook`,
  `StableLogSink`, `StableSupervisor`, `StableRunnerHost`.
- Add, remove, or reorder a field on a `#[stabby::stabby]` struct: `StableAddr`,
  `StableArg`, `NoteDepOutcome`, `ResultOutcome`, `QueryOutcome`, `NamedDriver`,
  `NamedHook`, `PluginComponents`.
- Change a `dynptr!` / type-alias: `DynRead`, `DynArtifact`, `DynItemStream`,
  `DynExecutor`, `DynProvider`, `DynManagedDriver`, `DynFunctionRegistry`,
  `DynHook`, `DynLogSink`, `DynSupervisor`, `DynRunnerHost`.
- Change the shape `hexecrunner::wire` encodes. It is not a stabby type — the
  `StableRunnerHost` method is bytes in, bytes out — so `get_stabbied` cannot
  reject a mismatch and a plugin would misparse a `prepare` instead of failing
  to load. It is frozen with this contract for exactly that reason.
- Rename or retype `CREATE_SYMBOL` or `CreateFn` — the entry point.
- Rename or retype an optional load-time symbol: `SET_LOG_SINK_SYMBOL`,
  `SET_SUPERVISOR_SYMBOL`, `SET_RUNNER_HOST_SYMBOL`. *Adding* one is additive —
  the host tolerates its absence — but changing one that exists is not.
- Change the `stabby` dependency version in any crate that links the boundary
  (`plugin-stabby`, `plugin-sdk`, `plugin-go-cdylib`). stabby keys its type reports
  to its own version; a mismatch fails `get_stabbied`.

A **removed** or **renumbered** proto field (vs an added one) is wire-breaking →
also major.

## What does NOT require a bump

- A new `ProviderMethod`/`DriverMethod` id + guest arm, a new proto field/variant —
  the additive lane above.
- Comments / doc changes with no layout effect.
- Host-only (`crate::host`) or guest-only (`crate::guest`, `plugin-sdk/serve`)
  adapter internals that don't touch the shared `abi` types.
- Engine-internal types that never cross the seam.

## Intentional breaks (pre-1.0)

Below 1.0 the contract may be redefined in place without bumping (no plugins are
released against it). To land a frozen-surface change without moving `ABI_SEMVER`,
put `ABI-BREAK-ACK: <reason>` in a commit message on the PR — the guard treats that
as an acknowledged break and passes. (Past 1.0, bump instead.)

When in doubt, bump. A false bump is cheap; a missed real break ships a host/plugin
pair that mismatches at load and aborts the plugin.
